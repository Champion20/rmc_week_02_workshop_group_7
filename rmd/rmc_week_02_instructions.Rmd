# Intro

In this workshop, you will work in groups to create a report on the burden of disease for three countries of your choice. The goal is to practice collaborative coding using GitHub and modular RMarkdown reports. 

Below you'll find the tasks to guide you through the process.

# TASK 1: FORK AND CLONE THE REPO

One group member (the repo "owner") should fork the template repository from The GRAPH Courses GitHub account. Then add the other group members as collaborators on the forked repo.

All group members should then clone the repo to their local machines.

# TASK 2: CHOOSE THREE COUNTRIES 

As a group, decide on three countries you want to analyze and compare in your report. Make sure each group member knows which countries were selected.

# TASK 3: COMPLETE THE CHILD DOCUMENTS

The repo contains a main RMarkdown file `burden_of_disease_report.Rmd` which pulls in three child documents:

1. `cmnn_burden.Rmd`: This document will compare the DALY burden of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases for the three countries.

2. `ncd_burden.Rmd`: This document will compare the DALY burden of non-communicable diseases for the three countries.

3. `overall_burden.Rmd`: This document will compare the overall DALY burden for the three countries.

Each group member should take responsibility for completing one of these child documents. If there are two group members, you should only complete two of the three child documents.

Within each child document, you need to:

- Import the relevant dataset from the `data` folder. There are three datasets available, one for each type of disease burden.
- Filter the data for your three chosen countries
- Create and render a table showing the DALY burden for the three countries in 2018 and 2019
- Create a plot visualizing the DALY burden over time for the three countries
- Write a very short explanatory paragraph interpreting the results

Each group member should complete these steps, commit their changes, and push to the remote repo.

# TASK 4: PULL AND RENDER THE MAIN REPORT

Once all group members have completed their child documents, the repo owner should pull everyone's changes. Then render the main `burden_of_disease_report.Rmd` which will pull in the completed child docs.

Commit and push the final rendered report to GitHub. 

Then go online to your repo and check that the report renders correctly.

# TASK 5: SUBMIT

To submit, each group member should paste the link to the group's GitHub repo in the submission box on the course platform.
