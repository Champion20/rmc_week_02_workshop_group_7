# Non-Communicable Disease Burden (NCD)

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the non-communicable diseases data
data_ncd <- read_csv(here("data", "burden-of-disease-ncd.csv"))
```

## Table of Estimates for NCD Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
data_ncd_clean <- data_ncd %>% filter(Entity %in% c("Benin", "Nigeria", "Cameroon")) %>% clean_names() %>% 
  rename(DALYS = "dal_ys_disability_adjusted_life_years_non_communicable_diseases_sex_both_age_age_standardized_rate")

ncd_wide <- data_ncd_clean %>%  pivot_wider(names_from = entity, 
                             values_from = DALYS, year) 
kable(ncd_wide)


```

## Plot Showing Trends in NCD Burden Over Time 

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.

ncd_long <-  ncd_wide %>% pivot_longer(names_to = "country",
                                       values_to = "value", -year)

ncd_long %>% ggplot(aes( y= value, x= year, color= country))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(y= "DALYS")+
  labs(title = "Trends in NCD burden over time by country")
```

## Summary of NCD Burden Findings

The burden of NCD showed a general decline across all three countries although Cameroon had a higher burden in the year 2000.
